We recommend that you adopt the latest API version available, if possible. If your current API version is much earlier than the new API version, incremental upgrades can help you identify the relevant changes to test.

You can update the API version of Apex classes, Apex triggers, and Visualforce pages from the corresponding Setup page. Updating the API version can include structural and behavior changes for objects and other code components. For example, an API change can add or remove fields on an object, introduce new outputs, or change the behavior of a field. We recommend that you back up your code before you upgrade the API version. Perform the upgrade in a sandbox, and complete thorough testing of all related functionality before you update production.
